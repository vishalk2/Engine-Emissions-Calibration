# Engine-Emissions-Calibration
1.Estimated the Torque output and the emission percentages of 'CO', 'HC' & 'NOx' emission constituents by varying Throttle along side the given Engine RPM range (Bench Marking).

2.Estimated the "Maximum Torques(and corresponding NOx emission %)" and "Minimum NOx emission %(and corresponding Torques)" Calibration.

3. Collaborated with other Interns in drafting out a final outline of "Engine emission consituents' percentages VS Torque Outputs" keeping in mind the Emission Norms.

This repo consists of -
  1. Estimated Data in an Excel Sheet.
  2. Editable Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR) csv file.
  3. Default Spark advance (table) csv file.
  4. Project Report

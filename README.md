# Engine-Emissions-Calibration
1.Estimated the Torque output and the emission percentages of 'CO', 'HC' & 'NOx' emission constituents by varying Throttle along side the given Engine RPM range (Bench Marking).

2.Estimated the "Maximum Torques(and corresponding NOx emission %)" and "Minimum NOx emission %(and corresponding Torques)" (Calibration).

3. Collaborated with other Interns in drafting out a final outline of "Engine emission consituents' percentages VS Torque Outputs" keeping in mind the latest Emission Norms.
